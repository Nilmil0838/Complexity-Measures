# Complexity-Measures

## This notebook does three things:

1. Makes three datasets each with varying degrees of complexity

- Linear  

- Polynomial + noise  

- Random

2. Trains three models on each dataset

- Linear Regression

- Decision Tree

- Neural Network MLP

3. Checks how well each model learns

- Training error

- Test error

- Generalization gap
